    "The simplest form of data-parallel programming is the parallel for loop.\n",

    "## Example: initializing the array values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def initializeArray(xs: Array[Int])(v: Int): Unit = {\n",
    "for (i <- (0 until xs.length).par) {\n",

    "`intializeArray` is a function that takes an array `xs` and intializes all the entries with value `v` in parallel. The parallel for loop looks like sequential, it calls `.par` on range and returns parallel range. Iterations of for-loop will be executed on different processors concurrently. In the body of for-loop each entry of array `xs` assigned value `v`. Parallel-loop doesn't return anything. Therefore not functional (since sideffects exist). A parallel for-loop is correct only if it writes to seperate memory locations or use synchronized locks. In our example this is assured by modifiying different memory locations.\n",

    "Render a set of complex numbers in the plane for which the sequence\n",
    "$z_{n+1} = z^2_n + c$ does not approach infinity (absolute value of numbers do not approach infinity). How do we visualize this on computer image?\n",
    "\n",
    "To each pixel on the screen, we compute the corresponding point in complex plane, we compute value of $z_n$ upto some maximum value of iterations. If the $|z_i| \\geq 2$ then sequence will approach infinity, otherwise if maximum numbers of iteration are reached we assume the sequence will never diverge. The color visually tells us how fast the sequence is diverging.\n"
