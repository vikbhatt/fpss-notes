    "\n",
    "Surprisingly enough, it turns out this is possible. However, we will need to relax the previous invariance on this data structure, so we will extend the Conc-Tree with a new node type. The idea will be to represent the result of a plus equals operation differently. For this reason, we will introduce a new type of a node called `Append`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Append node has exactly the same structure as the conc node does. It has a left and a right sub tree and it's level and size are defined in exactly the same way as they were for Conc notes. **However, we will not impose the previous balance in variant on the Append nodes. We will allow arbitrary difference in levels between the left and the right child**.\n",

Therefore, we would have to traverse and process all those nodes to eliminate them from the tree. And once again establish the balance in variance. The conversion to a normal Conc-Tree would have to take at least O(n) steps.\n",
